# Ruby Compatibility Examples

This repo is used to provide reproduction examples of (in)compatibilities in different Ruby implementations (MRI, JRuby, TruffleRuby).

(_The main idea is to let CI care about all the different Ruby versions, you shouldn't bother with installing all of them locally_).
